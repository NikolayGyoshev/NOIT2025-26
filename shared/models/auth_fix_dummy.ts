import { boolean } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

// Add this line to import boolean if it was missing or if I need to ensure the edit works
// This is a dummy write to fix the import in shared/models/auth.ts if needed, 
// but actually I should have just edited the import line in the edit tool.
// Re-reading: I used `edit` on `shared/models/auth.ts` to add the column, but I didn't add the `boolean` import.
// I must fix that first.
